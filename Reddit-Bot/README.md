IMPORTANT: The API Keys and password in my code are not my actual ones for security and privacy reasons. For the very top section, you would replace that information with yours to use the bot. 

The bot account I created for Reddit is: Responsible-Draw-99
You can see what I posted from it using the code

There are three main sections that are the main functions of this bot. They can not all be used at the same time. In order to use each one you turn the block of code into a comment or get rid of the comment. The section to submit posts is the one I have as not a comment because that is the most recent thing I ran.

The first section retrieves submissions from subreddits. You can change the submission limit to any number (I used 25 in this instance), as well as filter the time (I chose by week). 

The second section submits posts in any subreddit of your choosing as well as any message you choose. The subreddit I posted in is "testingground4bots". You can post whatever message you want.

The third section gets comments from a subreddit post and also has a part capable of replying to comments
