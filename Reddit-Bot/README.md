IMPORTANT: The API Keys and password in my code are not my actual ones for security and privacy reasons. For the very top section, you would replace that information with yours to use the bot. 

The bot account I created for Reddit is: Responsible-Draw-99
You can see what I posted from it using the code

There are three main sections that are the main functions of this bot. They can not all be used at the same time. In order to use each one you turn the block of code into a comment or get rid of the comment. The section to submit posts is the one I have as not a comment because that is the most recent thing I ran.

The first section retrieves submissions from subreddits

The second section submits posts in any subreddit of your choosing as well as any message you choose

The third section gets comments from a subreddit post and also has a part capable of replying to comments
